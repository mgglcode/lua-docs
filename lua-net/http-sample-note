http request examples for luasocket
kracekumar


I was looking for http library in lua and landed in luasocket.http page. 
It isn’t well documented, sent few GET, POST, PUT requests and figured 
few bits. This blog post aims in bridging the gap(code examples).

In this example, I will use httpbin as target site. The complete code 
is available as gist.

The following code should be executed like a standalone 
lua file(lua lua_httpbin.lua) and while executing the code in interpreter 
please make local variables http, ltn12, base_url as global variables.

(see code up to main())


http_request takes table as an argument which is almost similar to 
http.request function with an extra parameter params which will be helpful 
for passing parameters to GET request.

http_request{endpoint=endpoint, params={age=23, name="kracekumar"}} rather 
than http_request{endpoint=endpoint .. "?age=23&name=kracekumar"}.


My 2p

    When sending GET request don’t send paramters in request body.
    When sending POST request set custom header for form.

My experience of luasocket.http produces solid reason to create a new 
library with helper functions like requests (http://python-requests.org/).
